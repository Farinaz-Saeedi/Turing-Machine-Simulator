# Turing-Machine-Simulator
A Python-based Turing machine simulator that can recognize and process four different formal languages
using JSON-defined transition rules. This tool is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how
Turing machines work.

## Supported Languages
- palindrome 
- wcw
- n(a) = n(b)
- a^n b^n

## Features
- Reads machine definitions from JSON files describing states and transitions
- Simulates the machine step-by-step on user input strings
- Prints the tape and current state at each step
- Accepts or rejects the input based on the machineâ€™s final states
- Simple command-line interface for choosing language and entering input
